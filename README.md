# Raspberry Pi 3 Cookbook for Python Programmers - Third Edition
This is the code repository for [Raspberry Pi 3 Cookbook for Python Programmers - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/raspberry-pi-3-cookbook-python-programmers-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788629874), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Raspberry Pi 3 Cookbook for Python Programmers – Third Edition begins by guiding you through setting up Raspberry Pi 3, performing tasks using Python 3.6, and introducing the first steps to interface with electronics. As you work through each chapter, you will build your skills and apply them as you progress. You will learn how to build text classifiers, predict sentiments in words, develop applications using the popular Tkinter library, and create games by controlling graphics on your screen. You will harness the power of a built in graphics processor using Pi3D to generate your own high-quality 3D graphics and environments.

You will understand how to connect Raspberry Pi’s hardware pins directly to control electronics, from switching on LEDs and responding to push buttons to driving motors and servos. Get to grips with monitoring sensors to gather real-life data, using it to control other devices, and viewing the results over the internet. You will apply what you have learned by creating your own Pi-Rover or Pi-Hexipod robots. You will also learn about sentiment analysis, face recognition techniques, and building neural network modules for optical character recognition.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All chapters contain code files

The code will look like the following:
```
#!/usr/bin/python3
# bouncingball.py
import tkinter as TK
import time
VERT,HOREZ=0,1
xTOP,yTOP = 0,1
xBTM,yBTM = 2,3
MAX_WIDTH,MAX_HEIGHT = 640,480
xSTART,ySTART = 100,200
BALL_SIZE=20
RUNNING=True
```

Readers are expected to know the basics of Python programming.
It would be beneficial for readers to have a basic understanding of machine learning, computer vision, and neural networks.
